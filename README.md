# Lambda Complex: Source

**Lambda Complex: Source** is an open-source [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive) modification
for **PC** (Linux), Android, and WASM, which aims on recreating the [Half-Life: Opposing Force](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life:_Opposing_Force) game developed
by GearBox software in **1999**



## History
The history of this project is fairly simple. This project originally started under the name "**CSGO: Plus**", but later the original account which owned the "**CSGO: Plus**" repository was deleted. Later, a new project was made named "EmSource", which was based under the Source 2013 leak instead of the CSGO leak, but later, after a few days, the project was renamed to NeoSource, since Mohamed Ashraf wanted to to do something more than just simply port Source 2013 to Emscripten, he wanted to add new features. But later the project was renamed to **Lambda Complex: Source** where it is a remake of Opposing Force.

## FAQ

#### What version of Source does this run on?

**Lambda Complex: Source** runs off the CS:GO engine branch with features from other branches.

#### Is this legal to use?

Technically yes, since you may play the leak, because VALVe has allowed it (my evidence is because they haven't copyright struck other repositories), but you arent allowed to redistribute it under new licenses, nor sell it for commercial use.

#### Can I use this as a base for my mod?
Yes, you may, but you have to credit **Mohamed Ashraf** for the usage of **Lambda Complex: Source**'s features

#### Could you implement (insert feature here)
Yes I could, if you do want this feature implemented, either join the Discord, or create a GitHub issue.

#### Hey somebody plagirized your code, what can I do to help?
You can report their repository or if they have Discord, send me the link to it, and I will negotiate with the owner. Do not raid any servers, since these could just be kids.

#### What compiles on Emscripten?
Currently, tier1, tier2, and tier0 works on Emscripten (They compile), but currently, this is a work-in-progress, meaning that Emscripten isn't **FULLY** completed.
